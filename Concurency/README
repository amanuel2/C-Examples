# MulThreading vs MultiProccesing

Two Type of Concurent Models..

**Multithreading**

And

**MultiProccesing**

##MultiThreading

To Display:
                   Process 1       Process 2
  MultiThreading:  _________       ___________
                   |       |       |         |
                   |Funcion|       |Function |
                   |       |       |         |
                   |       | _____ |         |
                   |       |       |         |
                   |       |       |         |
                   |_______|       |_________|
                   
  Understanding the diagram:
    Basically as you can see above there are two processes.. That is exactly what MultiThreading is about. And in each process you see 
    there is only one running function. The middle line connecting them both is how the communicate, generaly called
    Interprocess Communication. They can share memory,etc...
    
    
##MultiProcessing

      ___________________________
       |                       |
       |Function 1  Function 2 |
       |    |          |       |
       |    |   _____  |       |
       |    |          |       |

     Understanding Diagram:
       Basically as you can see above there is only one process.. well in MultiProccing there is only one process, but MULTIPLE
       Threads. The line in the middle as you can see is thier Shared Memory, where they communicate and so on. But Notice there
       is only one process.
       
       
  #Pros and Cons
    MultiProcessing Pros:
       - Fast To Start
       - Low Overhead
       -Basically Much Better Performance
       
    Multithreading Pros:
      - Much Easier to implement
      - Can Be run on a distributed system
        unlie MultiProcessing
