##Task Switching
By doing a bit of one task and then a bit of another and so
on, it appears that the tasks are happening concurrently. This is called task switching.
We still talk about concurrency with such systems; because the task switches are so fast,
you canâ€™t tell at which point a task may be suspended as the processor switches to
another one.
