|   BITWISE RIGHT SHIFT
|
|   EXAMPLES: 
|
| y = 5;  x = 3;
| 
| Y in Binary = 000101
| X in Binary = 000011
| 
| X 
|
| y = 10; x = 16;
|  
|    
|
|
| 10100101 << 1  // move all bits 1 steps right. FILL with zeros. 
| =01001010  
|// no, you get truncation. You dropp off the ones that don't fit. You can never change the size of a variable.
|  0000001 >> 1
