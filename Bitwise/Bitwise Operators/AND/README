|   BITWISE AND
|
|   EXAMPLES: 
|
| y = 5;  x = 3;
| 
| Y in Binary = 000101
| X in Binary = 000011
| 
| X & Y = 000101 &
|         000011
|
|       = 000001
|
| y = 10; x = 16;
|  
| Y & X = 001010 & 
|         010000
|       = 000000  
|

Do you understand that it's one operation for each bit. 1 & 1 = 1... 1 & 0 = 0, and so on? 
Yeah. it just does that once for each bit. So, bit-wise WOW... 16 + 10 in binary is 0
